#simple-calculator

This python code is a simple calculator app (and by simple, I do mean it lol).
It was created for learning purposes to learn how pyfiglet as well as simple-term-menu. 
Also to get familiar/comfortable with using Poetry as a package manager.


This calculator app is simple enough to use.
You select the type of calculation you'd like to do (addition, subtraction, multiplication and division) then enter the two numbers you want to calculate.
These numbers can have decimals and an error will be thrown whenever an character is entered that's not a number.
Once the calculation is done, it will ask whether you woould want to do another one.
